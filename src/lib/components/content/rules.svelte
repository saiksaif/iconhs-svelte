    <h3>RULES AND REGULATIONS</h3>
    <h4>Code of conduct</h4>
    <p>
        The student handbook of the Inspire College of Nursing & Health Sciences contains the rules and regulations that must be followed by all students. In order to serve as an example for the junior student nurses, senior student nurses are expected to lead exemplary lives.
        <br>
        The nursing college's disciplinary committee will be notified of instances of cheating, dishonest behavior, social misconduct or rule violations, theft, intentional destruction of nursing college property, use of physical force against other students, patients, or staff, use of drugs, possession and use of weapons, inciting unrest and strikes, and repeated absences from classes and clinics without permission. The committee will recommend the necessary disciplinary action, which may include dismissal.
